Provide a fully branded experience by hosting the Member Portal on your own domain (e.g., `portal.yourdojo.com`) instead of the default subdomain.

## Configuration

1. Go to **Settings > General**.
2. Scroll to the **Custom Domain** section.
3. Enter your desired domain name.
4. Follow the DNS configuration instructions provided to verify ownership.

Once verified, your members can access their portal directly via your custom URL.
