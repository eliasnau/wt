You can configure templates for:
- **Monatsbeitrag**: Description for recurring monthly membership fees.
- **Aufnahmegebühr**: Description for the one-time joining fee charged upon registration.

| `%MONTH%` | The month name (e.g., January) |
| `%YEAR%` | The year (e.g., 2025) |
| `%MEMBER_NAME%` | The member's full name |
| `%MEMBER_ID%` | The member's unique ID number |

**Example:**
A template like `Monthly fee for %MEMBER_NAME% (%MONTH% %YEAR%)` would appear as `Monthly fee for John Doe (January 2025)`.
