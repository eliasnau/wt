<Callout>In this section, you manage the actual *users* of the software—your receptionists, instructors, and school administrators—not the students/members of your club. To manage your students, see [Managing Members](/docs/school/members).</Callout>

## Inviting a Staff Member

To give a new staff member access:

1. In your Dashboard, go to **Settings > Members** or visit [domain.com/dashboard/settings/members](https://domain.com/dashboard/settings/members).
2. Click the **Invite Member** button in the top right.
3. Enter their **Email Address**.
4. Assign a **Role** (e.g., Owner, Admin, Member). See [Permissions & Roles](/docs/settings/permissions) for details.
5. Send the invitation.

The user will receive an email containing instructions to join your Organization.

## User Limits

The number of staff members you can invite depends on your subscription plan.

- **Starter Plan**: Up to 2 users.
- **Pro Plan**: Up to 5 users.
- **Enterprise Plan**: Unlimited users.

See [Plans & Pricing](/docs/settings/pricing) for more details.

## Removing Users

If a staff member leaves or no longer needs access, you can remove them:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Members**.
2. Find the user in the list.
3. Click the menu options and select **Remove Member**.

This prevents them from accessing your Organization but does not delete their personal user account, allowing them to retain access to other organizations they may belong to.
