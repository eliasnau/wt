The **Active Sessions** list shows every device and browser currently logged into your account. This is a vital tool for ensuring no unauthorized users have access.

## Viewing Sessions

Navigate to **Account > Security** and scroll to **Sessions**. You will see a list containing:
- **Device Type**: Desktop, Mobile, etc.
- **Browser/OS**: Chrome on Windows, Safari on iOS, etc.
- **Location**: Approximate location based on IP address.
- **Last Active**: When the device last accessed the system.

<Callout type="info">
  Session locations are estimates based on IP addresses and may not always reflect the exact physical location of the device.
</Callout>

## Revoking Access

### Single Session
If you see a device you don't recognize or one you no longer use, click the **Revoke** or **Log Out** button next to it. That device will be immediately logged out.

### All Other Sessions
If you suspect your account has been compromised, use the **Revoke All Other Sessions** button. This will log out every device except the one you are currently using.

<Callout type="warn">
  We strongly recommend changing your password immediately after revoking all sessions if you suspect unauthorized access.
</Callout>
