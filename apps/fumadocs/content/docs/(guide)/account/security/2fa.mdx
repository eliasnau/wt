Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds a second step to the login process. In addition to your password, you will be asked to enter a code generated by an app on your phone.

## What is 2FA?

2FA significantly increases the security of your account. Even if someone guesses or steals your password, they cannot access your account without your physical device (your phone).

<Callout type="info">
  Enabling 2FA is **strongly recommended** for all users, especially those with access to sensitive member data.

## Enabling 2FA

### Save Backup Codes

**Crucial Step:** You will be shown a list of backup codes. Save these in a safe place (like a password manager). These are the *only* way to access your account if you lose your phone.

## Disabling 2FA

To disable 2FA, navigate to **Account > Security**, find the 2FA section, and click **Disable**.

  We do **not** advise disabling 2FA unless you are switching devices or have a specific reason to do so. It lowers the security of your account.
