Passkeys offer a faster and more secure way to sign in than passwords. They rely on your device's security capabilities, such as FaceID, TouchID, Windows Hello, or a YubiKey.

## What are Passkeys?

Passkeys are a modern replacement for passwords. Instead of typing a secret string of characters, your device uses cryptographic keys to authenticate you. This is actually **more secure** than a traditional password because passkeys cannot be phished or guessed.

  Passkeys are synced across your ecosystem (e.g., iCloud Keychain or Google Password Manager), so a passkey created on your iPhone will typically work on your Mac.

## Using Passkeys

Once set up, you can choose **Sign in with Passkey** on the login screen. Your device will prompt you for biometrics (like a fingerprint or face scan), and you'll be logged in securely.

## Managing Passkeys

You can view a list of all registered passkeys in the Security settings. If you lose a device, you should delete the associated passkey immediately to prevent unauthorized access.
