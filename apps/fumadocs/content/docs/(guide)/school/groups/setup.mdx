Groups in your martial arts school represent training classes, squads, or age brackets (e.g., "Tiny Tigers", "Adult BJJ", "Competition Team").

## Creating a Group

1. Navigate to **Groups** in the dashboard.
2. Click the **New Group** button.
3. In the slide-out sheet, enter:
    - **Name**: The display name for the group (e.g., "Kids", "Adults").
    - **Description**: An optional description of who the group is for.
    - **Default Membership Price**: An optional default price (e.g., 50.00 €) for memberships created within this group.
4. Click **Create Group**.

### Assigning Students

Once a group is set up, you can enroll students:

1. Open the group details.
2. Click **Enrol Members**.
3. Filter by rank or age to find eligible students.
4. Select and confirm enrollment.
