The **Members** section is the central hub for managing your martial arts school's students. Here you can view a list of all members, search for specific individuals, and filter the list to find exactly who you're looking for.

## Member List

The main view displays a table with the following information for each member:
- **First & Last Name**: The member's name. Cancelled members are marked with a red indicator.
- **Email & Phone**: Contact information.
- **Groups**: The training groups the member is currently assigned to.
- **Actions**: Buttons to view, edit, or manage the member.

## Searching and Filtering

You can easily find members using the search and filter tools at the top of the list.

### Search
Use the search bar to find members by **First Name**, **Last Name**, or **Email Address**. The list updates automatically as you type.

### Filter by Group
Click the **Groups** filter to view only members belonging to specific training groups. You can select multiple groups at once.

### View Options
Click the **More Options** (vertical dots) button to access additional filters:
- **Include Cancelled Members**: Toggle this to see members who have cancelled their contract but are still in the system (or whose cancellation date is in the future).
- **Show Archived Members**: Toggle this to view historical member records.

## Quick View

Clicking the **View** button (eye icon) on any member row opens a side sheet with a summary of their profile, including:
- Contact details
